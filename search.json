    "text": "Preface\nNutrition and food security surveys provide the information from which to assess the nutritional and food security status of a population. This document provides guidance on specific aspects of conducting nutrition and food security surveys. Chapters 1 to 6 focus on the various anthropometric measurements performed during nutrition surveys. Chapter 1 first describes two forms of undernutrition - acute undernutrition and chronic undernutrition - and then explains each including the signs and symptoms associated and the anthropometric indices used to diagnose them. Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 describe the equipment needed, the personnel required and the steps to undertake in performing weight, height, MUAC and oedema measurements respectively. Chapter 6 then discusses how survey personnel can be assessed as to their abilities to perform the various anthropometric measurements through a standardisation test.\nChapter 7 and 8 then talk about dietary diversity and food consumption, two indicator sets that are used for food security assessments. In Chapter 7, minimum dietary diversity for women (MDD-W) and minimum dietary diversity for children under 2 years (MDD) are discussed particularly the standard questionnaire used and the different food groups assessed. In Chapter 8, the food consumption score (FCS) is described including the standard questionnaire used and the different food groups assessed. Finally, Chapter 9 talks about the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS), the standard questions used to develop a questionnaire and the three food security domains it assesses.\nThroughout this document, there are boxed texts that are meant to provide either a note/information, a reminder, a warning related to the topic being discussed. In addition, there are boxed texts that point to downloadable forms or documents that the main body of text is referring to.",

This chapter discusses the various forms of childhood undernutrition, describes the indices used to diagnose them and the anthropometric measurements performed that will provide data to calculate the various indices.\nChildhood undernutrition manifests in various forms. It is important to note the use of the term undernutrition rather than malnutrition as this guide will not touch upon overweight and obesity. In this guide, the focus will be on two forms of undernutrition: acute undernutrition; and, chronic undernutrition. Childhood undernutrition manifested as micronutrient deficiencies will not be discussed.",

    "text": "1.1.1 Acute undernutrition\nChildhood acute undernutrition is a condition related to a child’s acute inadequate nutrition leading to rapid weight loss or failure to gain weight normally. Situations such as acute shortage of food and/or acute episodes of childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections and/or malaria can bring about this rapid weight loss or weight gain failure in children.\n\nPhysical signs and symptoms\nAcute undernutrition in a child can manifest in two ways.\n\nMarasmus\nThis condition is also called wasting given that a child suffering from it presents as wasted with an appearance of “skin and bones” because of excessive thinness that is due to rapid loss of muscle and fatty tissue. Other physical features include the child’s face looking like an old man’s (old man facies due to loss of facial subcutaneous fat), child’s rib cage is easily visible and skin folds on buttocks and thighs appearing like “baggy pants”.\n\n\nKwashiorkor\nSome children with acute undernutrition develop nutritional oedema. Oedema is an accumulation of fluid in the tissue, especially the feet and legs and nutritional oedema is specifically characterised as being bilateral and pitting. The child with kwashiorkor is withdrawn, irritable, obviously ill and will not eat. The hair is thin, sparse and sometimes discoloured. The skin has symmetrical discoloured patches where the skin later cracks and peels off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Child with bilateral oedema, skin, and hair changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Bilateral pitting oedema\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Children with kwashiorkor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthropometric indices\nThe physical signs and symptoms of acute undernutrition described above are considered pathognomonic of the condition i.e., if these signs and symptoms are found in a child, it is very likely that the child has acute undernutrition. However, other than physical signs, there are anthropometric indices used to diagnose acute undernutrition in children.\n\nWeight-for-height/weight-for-length\nThe first independent criteria for marasmus or wasting is weight-for-height (WFH)/weight-for-length (WFL). Given child A, this child’s weight is assessed against the mean weight of a standard group of children in good health with the same height or length as child A (length is measured when the child is &lt; 85 cms in height or &lt; 24 months old). Child A is expected to have a weight close to the mean weight of the standard group of healthy children if child A is also healthy and is not undernourished. However, if child A’s weight deviates significantly farther from the mean weight of the standard group of healthy children, child A is considered to have low weight for its height and therefore considered marasmic or wasted. This deviation from the mean, also called standard deviation (SD) in statistics, is calculated for each child whose weight and height have been measured and is expressed in terms of z-scores. Therefore, the anthropometric index used for wasting is weight-for-height z-scores (WHZ) and classification of level of wasting is done based on the following WHZ cut-offs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHZ\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nWHZ &lt; -2SD\nGlobal Acute malnutrition (GAM)\n\n\n-3SD \\(\\geq\\) WHZ &lt; -2SD\nModerate acute malnutrition (MAM)\n\n\n\nWHZ &lt; -3SD\nSevere acute malnutrition (SAM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMid-upper arm circumference\nThe other independent criteria for marasmus or wasting is the mid-upper arm circumference or MUAC. MUAC is a measure of muscle mass and therefore detects loss of muscle mass due to wasting. MUAC is a good predictor of mortality and in many studies, MUAC predicted death in children better than any other anthropometric indicator. Unlike weight-for-height, MUAC is used as an anthropometric index without need for standardisation. The MUAC cut-offs used to classify a child as being marasmic or wasted are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMUAC (mm)\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nMUAC &lt; 125\nGlobal Acute malnutrition (GAM)\n\n\n115 \\(\\geq\\) MUAC &lt; 125\nModerate acute malnutrition (MAM)\n\n\n\nMUAC &lt; 115\nSevere acute malnutrition (SAM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOedema test\nThe final index for acute undernutrition is oedema testing for kwashiorkor cases. This test checks whether oedema is present and whether it is bilateral and pitting. Any sign of bilateral pitting oedema, regardless of WHZ or MUAC classification, is considered severe acute malnutrition.\n\n\n\nReferral for cases with acute undernutrition\nChildren with acute undernutrition are at higher risk of mortality than children who are not. Children with moderate acute malnutrition are 3 times more likely to die while children with severe acute undernutrition are 5 times more likely to die than their non-undernourished counterparts. It is therefore important that when children are identified as having acute undernutrition based on the anthropometric indices described above, they are referred accordingly for treatment. For MUAC and oedema, the diagnosis of acute undernutrition is clear and straightforward and those who measure or check for them would be able to immediately determine child’s nutritional status and refer accordingly. With the weight-for-height index, the process is less straightforward because the weight and height measurements will have to be converted into z-scores which in turn are used to check against the stated cut-offs. In order to facilitate this conversion to z-scores particularly on-the-go in a field survey setting, the WHO provides reference tables that can be used to look up a child’s height/length and weight in the appropriate reference table specific to the child’s sex and age and then be able to determine the child’s z-score. The reference tables are shown below (Figure 1.2 (a), Figure 1.2 (b), Figure 1.2 (c), Figure 1.2 (d)) and can be downloaded from the links on the right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\nReference tables for boys 0-23 months - PDF\nReference tables for boys 24-59 months - PDF\nReference tables for girls 0-23 months - PDF\nReference tables for girls 24-59 months - PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Reference tables for boys 0-23 months\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Reference tables for boys 24-59 months\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Reference tables for girls 0-23 months\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Reference tables for girls 0-23 months\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Reference look-up tables for acute undernutrition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nCase: During the survey, you found a 10 month old girl with a length of 48.0 cms and weight of 3.3 kgs.\nIn this example, you will have to use the reference table for girls 0-24 months old.\nFind the length of the child on the reference table. In the left-most column of the reference table you will find the values for the length in centimetres (Figure 1.3). So for this child, you should look for 48.0 cm length in the left-most column (Figure 1.4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Values for length in centimetres\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Look for 48.0 cms length\n\n\n\nOnce you have found the girl’s length in the left-most column, you now have to look for the girl’s weight in the body of the table (Figure 1.5). Specifically, you should look for the girl’s weight along the row corresponding to her length (Figure 1.6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Values for weight in kilograms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Look for weight of girl in row for her length\n\n\n\nThe weight of the child (3.3 kg) is indicated in Figure 1.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Weight of child\n\n\n\nThen, to determine the z-score corresponding to the girl’s height and weight, look up to the the uppermost row (header row) of the table where you will find the z-score values (Figure 1.8). Specifically, you should look up to the uppermost row (header row) of the column corresponding to the weight of the child (Figure 1.9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: Header row\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: Header corresponding to weight of child\n\n\n\nSo, in this example, the girl has a z-score of +1SD. The girl is not acutely undernourished.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Chronic undernutrition\nChildhood chronic undernutrition is a condition related to a child’s exposure to inadequate nutrition over a long period of time leading to failure of linear growth. Stunted growth reflects a process of failure to reach linear growth potential as a result of suboptimal health and/or nutritional conditions.\n\nPhysical signs and symptoms\nA child suffering from chronic undernutrition is also called stunting/stunted. Such a child is said to be short for its age (see below).\n\n\nAnthropometric indices\nLike with acute undernutrition, an index is used to classify whether a child has chronic malnutrition or not. This index is called height-for-age (HFA) or length-for-age (LFA). Given child B, this child’s length/height is assessed against the mean length/height of a standard group of children in good health with the same age as child B. Child B is expected to have a length/height close to the mean length/height of the standard group of healthy children if child B is also health and well-nourished. However, if child B’s length/height deviates significantly farther from the mean height of the standard group of healthy children, child B is considered to have low height for its age and therefore considered to be stunting or stunted. This deviation from the mean, also called standard deviation (SD) in statistics, is calculated for each child whose height has been measured and is expressed in terms of z-scores. Therefore, the anthropometric index used for stunting/stuntedness is height-for-age z-scores (HAZ) and classification of level of stunting/stuntedness is done based on the following WHZ cut-offs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHAZ\nClassification\n\n\n\n\nHAZ &lt; -2SD\nGlobal stunting/stuntedness\n\n\n-3SD \\(\\geq\\) HAZ &lt; -2SD\nModerate stunting/stuntedness\n\n\nHAZ &lt; -3SD\nSevere stunting/stuntedness",

    "text": "2.1.1 Types of weighing scales\nVarious types of scales are available to measure the weight of a child: spring scales; hanging scales; beam balance scales; and, digital scales.\nSpring scales are the most common type of scales used worldwide. Hanging scales (Figure 2.1 (b)) are a kind of spring scale that is hung from a height instead of laid flat on the ground. Hanging scales are commonly preferred in many countries because they can be transported easily, can be used in almost any setting (particularly where a flat surface is not available) and are relatively inexpensive. However, they are not very accurate and as such are not recommended for use in nutrition surveys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Bathroom scale (spring)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Hanging scale (spring)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Types of spring scales\n\n\n\nBalance beam scales (Figure 2.2) are commonly used in health centres, as they need to be positioned on a flat surface for accurate measurement and are not easily transported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Balance beam scales\n\n\n\nDigital scales on the other hand are highly accurate (for as long as it is powered adequately and consistently), easily transportable though requiring a flat surface on which to be laid upon. They are generally of high quality and rugged for frequent field use as is needed for a nutrition survey. This is why digital scales are what’s currently recommended for use in anthropometric measurements in a field survey setting.\nIn addition to being a digital scale, it is recommended to weigh children using a scale with the following features:\n\nSolidly built and durable\nElectronic (digital reading)\nMeasures up to 150 kg\nMeasures to a precision of 0.1 kg (100g)\nAllows tared weighing\n\n“Tared weighing” means that the scale can be re-set to zero (“tared”) with the person just weighed still on it. Thus, a mother can stand on the scale, be weighed, and the scale tared. While remaining on the scale, if she is given her child to hold, the child’s weight alone appears on the scale.\nDigital scales that allow for tared weighing have very clear advantages:\n\nThere is no need to subtract weights to determine the child’s weight alone (reducing the risk of error).\nThe child is likely to remain calm when held in the mother’s arms for weighing.\n\nCurrently, the most commonly used digital tared weighing scale is the UNICEF Electric Scale (UNISCALE) which is produced by SECA (the non-UNICEF branded scale is the SECA model 890 or SECA model 874 - Figure 2.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: SECA scale model 874\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 General use, care and maintenance of SECA tared scales\n\nPlace the scale on a hard, level surface (wood, concrete, or firm earth). Soft or uneven surfaces may cause small errors in weighing. It is therefore advisable that each survey team are provided with a wooden plank that can be laid on top of unlevel ground as a way to even out the surface (Figure 2.4). The plank should be big enough to cover a reasonable surface and sturdy enough to carry the weight of the scale and those being weighed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Weighing scale on a wooden plank\n\n\n\n\nThe scale will not function correctly if it becomes too warm. It is best to use the scale in the shade, or indoors. If the scale becomes hot and does not work correctly, place it in a cooler area and wait 15 minutes before using again.\nThe scale must adjust to changes in temperature. If the scale is moved to a new site with a different temperature, wait for 15 minutes before using the scale again. It is advisable to test the scale before every measurement when the scale is moved and operated in extreme weather conditions.\nThe scale must be tested every single day of fieldwork. This is best done using a labelled standard weight of 2.5 - 5.0 kg. This can be purchased locally, but must be tested initially to ensure that the indicated weight is accurate. Record the results of the daily test of the scale, including the date and weight. Using other types of standard weights is possible, but is not recommended. Some surveys have in the past used filled water bottles for testing, but as water or other liquids evaporate, this technique is flawed. Sand is a viable alternative, but only if labelled weights are not available.\nHandle the scale carefully:\n\n\nDo not drop or bump the scale.\nDo not weigh loads with a total weight of more than 150 kg.\nDo not store the scale in direct sunlight or other hot places.\nProtect the scale against excess humidity or wetness.\nDo not use the scale at temperatures below 10º C or above 45º C.\n\n\nThe scale is battery-powered. Around 120,000 weighings can be performed with a fresh set of batteries.",

    "text": "2.3 Steps in weighing a child\n\nPrepare the child for weighing\n\nExplain to parents/caretakers that the child needs to remove outer clothing in order to obtain an accurate weight. A wet diaper, or shoes and jeans, can contribute substantially to the measured weight (up to 0.5 kgs) making the measurement inaccurate. Babies should be weighed naked but precautions needs to be put in place to ensure that the baby stay warm while waiting to be weighed and while they are being weighed. They can be wrapped in a blanket to keep them warm while waiting. When being weighed, the adult can be weighed holding a blanket that can be used to wrap around the naked baby during measurement. Older children should remove all but minimal clothing, such as their underclothes.\nIf it is too cold to undress a child or if the child resists being undressed and becomes agitated, please weigh the clothed child, but indicate in the questionnaire that the child could not be undressed to the minimum and take a note of the circumstances. To be able to adjust the weight of clothed children, weigh one set of child’s clothing separately and record. This weight will be used in adjusting the weight measurement of all children weighed with clothes on.\n\nSwitch on scale\n\nThe measurers should switch on the scale with no weight applied. The SECA 874 can be turned on by tapping the start button (Figure 2.5 (a)). The SECA 890 can be turned on by covering the solar cells for less than a second (Figure 2.5 (b)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Turning on the SECA 874\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Turning on the SECA 890\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: How to turn on SECA tared scales\n\n\n\nWhen the SECA 890 is switched on, you will first notice the display showing 188.8. Wait for the display to turn 0.0 before putting any weight onto the scale. The assistant on the other hand will be holding onto the paper questionnaire or the mobile device. The assistant will be in charge of recording the weight measurement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: SECA 890 ready\n\n\n\n\nWeighing the child\n\nThis step differs between children who are able to stand still on the scale long enough for a measurement to be read and recorded and children who are too young to do so. Generally, children 2 years and above should be able to stand on the scale still on their own long enough. However, it is to the discretion of the measurer whether this is the case or not.\n\nWeigh child on scale on their own\n\nIf child is able to stand still on the scale long enough, the child can be weighed alone. Measurer should explain to the child that he/she will need to step on to the scale alone and standing very still. Measurer will ask the child to stand in the middle of the scale, feet slightly apart and to remain still until the weight appears and that the measurement is retained on the display (about 3 seconds that the measurement is stable with child standing still and not moving the display will stop flashing signifying that the weight display has been stored). It is important that no one holds or supports the child until a weight measurement has been retained on the display successfully as this will interfere with the measurement. If the child does not stand still or is unable or does not want to stand on his/her own, then step b below should performed instead.\nThe measurer then reads out loud the child’s weight from the display. The measurer should read the measurement entirely including the one decimal place that shows in display (to the nearest 0.1 kg). Note that when using the SECA 874, the weight is displayed with two decimal places but the second decimal number is always 0. The second decimal place is not recorded.\nThe assistant then repeats the weight that has been called out.\nThe measurer then confirms if this is the correct weight. If correct, then the assistant records the weight measurement on the paper questionnaire or on the mobile device. If incorrect, measurer reads out the measurement again until the assistant is able to repeat the correct weight.\nThe child can then step off the scale.\n\nTared weighing\n\nIf child is unable to stand still on the scale long enough or if child doesn’t want to stand on the scale alone, then this child should be measured using tared weighing.\nThe measurer asks the mother/caretaker to step onto the scale and then to stand still (Figure 2.7). After about 3 seconds, the weight of the mother/caretaker will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Weighing the adult first on the SECA 874\n\n\n\nIf using the SECA 874, the measurer will have to press the 2 in 1 key found on the scale (Figure 2.8). This will store the weight of the mother/caretaker. The display on the device would show 0.0 reading and the word NET indicating that the weight of the mother/caretaker has been stored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Taring the SECA 974\n\n\n\nIf using the SECA 890, the measurer will have to cover the solar cell of the device (Figure 2.9) for less than a second and the display will revert back to 0.0 reading. This indicates that the weight of the mother/caretaker has been stored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Taring the SECA 890\n\n\n\nThe measurer then asks the mother/caretaker to hold/carry the baby/child on their arms and to again stand as still as possible. The display will show a weight measure. If the weight display and the message HOLD are flashing, it means that the scale is waiting for the measurement to stabilise (Figure 2.10). The measurer should wait for the weight display and the message HOLD to stop flashing before reading the weight measurement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: SECA 874 on hold\n\n\n\nOnce the weight display has stopped flashing, The measurer reads out loud the child’s weight from the display. The measurer should read the measurement entirely including the one decimal place that shows in display. Note that when using the SECA 874, the weight is displayed with two decimal places but the second decimal number is always 0. The second decimal place is not recorded.\nThe assistant then repeats the weight that has been called out.\nThe measurer then confirms if this is the correct weight. If correct, then the assistant records the weight measurement on the paper questionnaire or on the mobile device. If incorrect, measurer reads out the measurement again until the assistant is able to repeat the correct weight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReminders\n\n\n\n\nAlways calibrate scales ever day in the morning before data collection.\nAlways measure weight before height.\nIf there is more than 1 eligible child in a household, always weigh the less agitated one first.\nTry and obtain scales that are sturdy but light enough to be carried easily by the team.\nMeasure weight without clothes.",

If human resources are not an issue, a three-person team would be ideal especially when taking the length of the child. For a two-person team, one is assigned as the measurer while the other is assigned as the assistant. It is important that prior to the measurement of the height of a child that these roles are clearly specified and that each personnel knows what their role entails. Switching roles between measurement of different children is acceptable for as long as all personnel are trained on performing the tasks expected of either measurer or assistant.

    "text": "3.3 Steps in measuring length or height of child\nDepending on the age of the child, either the weight or the length is measured. For children less than 24 months old (or for height less than 85 cms), length should be measured i.e., height board on recumbent position with the child lying down using a length board which should be placed on a flat, stable surface such as a table (Figure 3.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Length board flat on a table surface\n\n\n\nFor children 24 months and older, height should be measured i.e., height board on the vertical position with the child standing up (unless child is unable to stand). Use a height board mounted at a right angle between a level floor and against a straight, vertical surface such as a wall or pillar (Figure 3.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Height board mounted upright\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges with measuring length\n\n\n\nMeasuring children standing up is much easier. Length is much more difficult to measure than height.\nStanding height is about 0.7 cm less than recumbent length. This difference was taken into account in developing the WHO growth standards. Therefore, it is important to adjust the measurements if length is taken instead of height, and vice versa.\n\nIf a child less than 2 years old will not lie down for measurement of length, measure standing height and add 0.7 cm to convert it to length.\nIf a child aged 2 years or older cannot stand, measure recumbent length and subtract 0.7 cm to convert it to height.\n\nIt is recommended that this adjustment to not be made by enumerators during the survey. Instead, an entry in the data collection form / survey instrument should be included that indicates whether measurement made was a height or a length measurement. This will allow adjustments to be made to the height/length measurements post-survey.\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Measuring height\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Steps in measuring height\n\n\n\n\nMeasurer or Assistant should place the measuring board on a hard flat surface against a wall, table, tree, staircase, etc. Make sure the board is stable. Check that shoes, socks and hair ornaments have been removed.\nMeasurer or Assistant should ask the mother to remove the child’s shoes and unbraid any hair that would interfere with the height measurement. Ask mother to walk the child to the board and to kneel in front of the child.\nAssistant should place the paper questionnaire or mobile device on the ground (arrow 1) and kneel with both knees on the right side of the child (arrow 2).\nMeasurer should kneel on their right knee only, for maximum mobility, on the child’s left side (arrow 3).\nAssistant should place the child’s feet flat and together in the centre of and against the back and base of the board. The assistant should place right hand just above the child’s ankles on the shins (arrow 4) with left hand on the child’s knees (arrow 5) and push against the board making sure the child’s legs are straight and the heels and calves are against the board (arrows 6 and 7). The assistant then notifies the measurer when positioning of the feet and legs is complete.\nMeasurer tells the child to look straight ahead at the mother if she is in front of the child. Make sure the child’s line of sight is level with the ground (arrow 8). Measurer places open left hand on the child’s chin and gradually closes hand (arrow 9) taking care that the child’s mouth or ears are not covered. The measurer makes sure the shoulders are level (arrow 10), the hands are at the child’s side (arrow 11), and the head, shoulder blades and buttocks are against the board (arrows 12, 13 and 14). With the right hand, the measurer lowers the headpiece on top of the child’s head making sure that the headpiece pushes through the child’s hair (arrow 15).\nMeasurer and Assistant should check the child’s position (arrow 1-15) and repeating any steps necessary.\nWhen the child’s position is correct, the measurer reads and calls out the measurement to the nearest 0.1cm. Then, the measurer removes the headpiece from the child’s head and releases the left hand from the child’s chin and supports the child during the recording.\nAssistant immediately records the measurement and shows it to the measurer.\nMeasurer checks the recorded measurement on the questionnaire for accuracy and legibility and instructs the assistant to erase and correct any errors.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncertainty about child’s age\n\n\n\nIf you are unsure or not confident in the precision of the child’s age (over age 2), please take measurement as described above. If the child’s height is measured to less than 85 cm, you must instead measure the child’s length (see Section 3.3.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon mistakes when measuring height\n\n\n\n\nchild leaning to one side;\nheels not touching the board; and,\nhands not at side.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Measuring length\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Steps in measuring length\n\n\n\n\nMeasurer or assistant places the measuring board on a hard flat surface, such as the ground, floor or a steady table. Cover the length board with a thin cloth or soft paper for hygiene and for the baby’s comfort.\nAssistant places the paper questionnaire or the mobile device on the ground, floor or table (arrow 1) and kneels with both knees behind the base of the board, if it is on the ground or floor (arrow 2).\nMeasurer kneels on the child’s right side and holds the footpiece with right hand (arrow 3).\nWith the mother’s/caretaker’s help, the measurer and assistant should lay the child on the board. The assistant should support the back of the child’s head with hands and gradually lower the child onto the board. The measurer on the other hand supports the child at the trunk of the body.\nMeasurer or assistant asks the mother/caretaker to kneel on the opposite side of the board facing the measurer to help keep the child calm.\nAssistant cups hands over the child’s ears (arrow 4). With arms comfortably straight (arrow 5), assistant places the child’s head against the base of the board so that the child is looking straight up (Figure 3.6). The child’s line of sight should be perpendicular to the ground (arrow 6). The assistant’s head should be straight over the child’s head and looking directly into the child’s eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Positioning child’s head against the base of the board\n\n\n\n\nMeasurer makes sure the child is lying flat and in the centre of the board (arrow 7) and places left hand on the child’s shins (above the ankles) or on the knees (arrow 8) pressing them firmly against the board (Figure 3.7). Note that with the right hand, measurer places the footpiece firmly against the child’s heels (arrow 9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Measurer and assistant working together to position child\n\n\n\n\nMeasurer and assistant checks the child’s position (arrows 4-9) and repeats any steps as necessary to correct child’s position.\nWhen the child’s position is correct, measurer reads and calls out the measurement to the nearest 0.1 centimetre. The measurer then removes the footpiece, releases left hand from the child’s shins or knees and supports the child during the recording.\nThe assistant then immediately releases the child’s head, records the measurement on the paper questionnaire or mobile device and shows it to the measurer. Alternatively, the assistant calls out the measurement and have the measurer confirm by repeating back.\nAssistant records whether the child was measured lying down or standing up.\nMeasurer checks the recorded measurement on the questionnaire for accuracy and legibility then instructs the assistant to cancel and correct any errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncertainty about child’s age\n\n\n\nIf you are unsure or not confident in the precision of the child’s age (under age 2), take measurement as described above. If the child’s length is measured to 85 cm or more, you must instead measure the child’s height (see Section 3.3.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon mistakes when measuring length\n\n\n\n\ntoes pointed;\nknees bent; and,\nhead lifted off the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReminders with measuring height/length\n\n\n\n\nThe measuring boards should be at least 130 cm in length and be made of treated wood.\nThere should be measuring tape on both sides of the measuring board.\nThe measuring board must be cleaned before being stored.\nRecord measurements to the nearest 0.1 cm.",

Very young children can be held by their mother during this procedure. Ask the mother to remove clothing that may cover the child’s left arm.\nMeasurer calculates the midpoint of the child’s left upper arm by first locating the tip of the child’s shoulder (arrows 1 and 2) with finger tips. Bend the child’s elbow to make a right angle (arrow 3). Place the tape at zero, which is indicated by two arrows, on the tip of the shoulder (arrow 4) and pull the tape straight down past the tip of the elbow (arrow 5). Read the number at the tip of the elbow to the nearest centimetre. Divide this number by two to estimate the midpoint. As an alternative, bend the tape up to the middle length to estimate the midpoint. A piece of string can also be used for this purpose. Either you or an assistant can mark the midpoint with a pen on the arm (arrow 6).\nMeasurer straightens the child’s arm and wraps the tape around the arm at midpoint. Make sure the numbers are right side up. Make sure the tape is flat around the skin (arrow 7).\nMeasurer and assistant inspects the tension of the tape on the child’s arm. Make sure the tape has the proper tension (arrow 7) and is not too tight or too loose (arrows 8-9).

Once all personnel have had the opportunity to adequately practice their measurement and recording techniques, a standardisation test or exercise must be carried out. This chapter provides detailed instructions on how to carry out an anthropometric measurement standardisation test as part of a training process in preparation for a nutrition survey.\nThe standardisation test evaluates the precision and the accuracy of the measurements taken by each survey personnel.\nThe accuracy of measurements taken by survey personnel is determined by how close they are to the true value with repeated measurements. On the other hand, the precision of measurements taken by survey personnel is determined by how similar the values are of repeated measurements made. In preparation for a nutrition survey while the survey personnel are in training, the aim is for survey personnel to be highly accurate and highly precise with their anthropometric measurements.",

For example if there are 20 survey personnel, a unique ID from 1 to 20 is given to each survey personnel. The supervisor’s ID is always 0.\nEach measurement station should have a height board, weighing scale and a MUAC tape\nEach child must remain with their mother in a fixed station with a unique ID number. For example if there are 10 mother and children pairs, a unique ID from 1 to 10 is given to each pair\nIt is not allowed for pairs of survey personnel to speak with other pairs during the test\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Timeframe\nIn order to follow the test parameters specified above and organise the test appropriately, a considerable amount of time needs to be set aside for conducting the test.\nFor a survey team of about 20 survey personnel, the test can be carried out in 2 half-days such that half of the survey personnel (first half of each team) measures 10 children in the morning and the other half (second half of each team) measures the same 10 children in the afternoon.\nIt would be possible to have a different set of 10 children for the afternoon session. However, the results of the first half who took the test in the morning cannot be combined with the results of the second half who took the test in the afternoon.\nFor larger scale surveys with survey personnel more than 20, more days will be required to conduct the test to appropriately and to correct specifications.\n\n\n6.2.4 Steps in carrying out the standardisation test\n\nThe supervisor carefully performs the measurements on each child without allowing the teams to see the values. The supervisor records his/her measurements on the standardisation test form for the first round of measurements.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Example of a standardisation test form\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChild ID\nWeight (kg)\nHeight (cm)\nMUAC (mm)\nOedema (yes/no)\n\n\n\n\n01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\nSample standardisation test form - PDF\n\n\nEach team starts with a different child, and the first half of the team measures the child once and records the results in a standard form for the 1st measurement (as above). The current measurer should make sure that he/she is entering data in the row corresponding to the child ID of the child he/she is currently measuring.\nWhen the first half of the team has done the measurements for the current child, they should move on to the next child. After the first half of all the teams has measured 10 children once, the first measurement round forms are handed in. The teams and the children then take a break. Appropriate incentives including food and drinks to snack on during the break should be provided to the mothers and children.\nAfter the break, the first half of the team repeats the whole process and measures each child for the second time and records his/her measurements onto the standardisation test form for the second round of measurements. After the the first half of all the teams has measured 10 children twice, the second measurement round forms are handed in. The teams and the children then take a break for lunch (end of first half of the day/first half of the test). Appropriate lunch arrangements should be prepared for the mothers and children.\nAfter the lunch break or on a new day altogether, the whole process is done all over again but this time, the second half of the teams will be performing the measurements. Ideally, the same set of mother and child pairs should be utilised for the second half day of testing. However, it may be that some of the mothers will be unable to come back to help. If for the second half day of testing the mother and child pairs are different from the first half day, then measurements made in the second half day cannot be mixed with the data from the first half day when reporting on the performance in the standardisation test of the survey personnel.",

    "text": "7.1 Introduction\nDietary diversity can be measured in various ways with the traditional approach being time consuming, expensive, and requiring a high level of technical skill both in data collection and analysis. Recent development work in this indicator has brought about the use of a qualitative approach to food consumption that reflects household access to a wide variety of foods, and is also a proxy of the nutrient adequacy of the diet for individuals. The approach uses a specifically designed and tested dietary diversity questionnaire as a tool to elicit food consumption information in a more rapid, user-friendly and cost-effective approach. Administration of the questionnaire is straightforward and can be handled easily by trained enumerators. The scoring and/or analysis of the information gained from the questionnaire is easy to understand, quick to implement, and can be applied with minimal technical expertise.\nIn general, dietary diversity indicators are created by summing either the number of individual foods or food groups consumed over a reference period. This chapter describes how an individual dietary diversity indicator is created through a simple count of food groups that an individual has consumed over the past 24 hours. Specifically, this chapter discusses how the minimum dietary diversity indicator for women (MDD-W) and the minimum dietary diversity indicator for children under 2 years old (MDD) are calculated using a standard dietary diversity questionnaire.",

The proportion of children 6–23 months of age who receive foods from 4 or more food groups is associated with better quality diets for both breastfed and non-breastfed children. Consumption of foods from at least 4 food groups on the previous day would mean that in most populations the child had a high likelihood of consuming at least one animal-source food and at least one fruit or vegetable that day, in addition to a staple food (grain, root or tuber).\nThe indicator is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{MDD} = \\frac{\\text{Children 6–23 months of age who received foods from} \\geq \\text{ 4 food groups during the previous day}}{\\text{Children 6–23 months of age}} \\]\nThe 7 foods groups used for tabulation of this indicator are:\n\nGrains, roots and tubers\nLegumes and nuts\nDairy products (milk, yoghurt, cheese)\nFresh foods (meat, fish, poultry and liver/organ meats)\nEggs\nVitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables\nOther fruits and vegetables\n\nConsumption of any amount of food from each food group is sufficient to “count”, i.e., there is no minimum quantity, except if an item is only used as a condiment.\n\n7.3.1 MDD questionnaire\nFollowing is a model questionnaire used for MDD component of IYCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and filters\nResponse\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nPorridge, bread, rice, noodles, or other foods made from grains\nYes = 1 No = 2\n\n\n\nB\nPumpkin, carrots, squash, or sweet potatoes that are yellow or orange inside\nYes = 1 No = 2\n\n\n\nC\nWhite potatoes, white yams, manioc, cassava, or any other foods made from roots\nYes = 1 No = 2\n\n\n\nD\nAny dark green leafy vegetables\nYes = 1 No = 2\n\n\n\nE\nRipe mangoes, ripe papayas, or (insert other local vitamin A-rich fruits)\nYes = 1 No = 2\n\n\n\nF\nAny other fruits or vegetables\nYes = 1 No = 2\n\n\n\nG\nLiver, kidney, heart, or other organ meats\nYes = 1 No = 2\n\n\n\nH\nAny meat, such as beef, pork, lamb, goat, chicken, or duck\nYes = 1 No = 2\n\n\n\nI\nEggs\nYes = 1 No = 2\n\n\n\nJ\nFresh or dried fish, shellfish, or seafood\nYes = 1 No = 2\n\n\n\nK\nAny foods made from beans, peas, lentils, nuts, or seeds\nYes = 1 No = 2\n\n\n\nL\nCheese, yoghurt, or other milk products | Yes = 1 No = 2\n\n\nM\nAny oil, fats, or butter, or foods made with any of these\nYes = 1 No = 2\n\n\n\nN\nAny sugary foods such as chocolates, sweets, candies, pastries, cakes, or biscuits\nYes = 1 No = 2 Yes = 1 No = 2\n\n\n\nO\nCondiments for flavour, such as chillies, spices, herbs, or fish powder\nYes = 1 No = 2\n\n\n\nP\nGrubs, snails, or insects\nYes = 1 No = 2\n\n\n\nQ\nFoods made with red palm oil, red palm nut, or red palm nut pulp sauce\nYes = 1 No = 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.2 MDD food group description\nThe food group description for MDD-W is about the same for the IYCF MDD with a few exceptions:\n1. Ice cream\nIn MDD-W, ice cream is categorised as “sweets” because it is a high fat/high sugar food. For IYCF MDD, ice cream is categorised as dairy.\nThis difference is primarily due to increasing concerns with other dimensions of diet quality in the context of the nutrition transition given that ice cream is a high fat and high sugar food and also because many low-quality ice cream products contain very little dairy.\n2. Garlic\nIn MDD-W, garlic is categorised as “condiments and seasonings” given that it is usually consumed in small quantities. In IYCF MDD, there is no particular concern for food quantity so garlic is categorised as “other fruits and vegetables”.\n3. Olives\nIn MDD-W, olives are categorised as “other foods and beverages” given that it is usually consumed in small quantities. In IYCF MDD, olives are categorised as “other fruits and vegetables”.\n4. Red palm oil\nIn MDD-W, this is totally excluded from the indicator calculation. In IYCF MDD, it is counted under “vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables”\n5. Fish roe\nIn MDD-W, categorised with “insects and other small protein foods”. In IYCF MDD, categorised under “fish and seafood”\n6. Seaweed\nIn MDD-W, categorised as “other vegetables”. In IYCF MDD, categorised as “dark green leafy vegetables”.",

The FCS is a household level indicator that aggregates food group diversity and frequency over the past 7 days. These food groups are then weighted according to their relative nutritional value. This means that food groups that are nutritionally-dense such as animal products are given greater weight than those containing less nutritionally dense foods such as tubers. The weights are then added up to come up with a household score which are then used to classify households into either poor, borderline, or acceptable food consumption.

These domains are:\n\nAnxiety and uncertainty about the household food supply\nInsufficient Quality (includes variety and preferences of the type of food)\nInsufficient food intake and its physical consequences\n\nThis indicator set on domains consists of responses to the individual occurence questions referring to each of the domains. The indicators in this set provide specific, disaggregated information about the behaviours and perceptions of the surveyed households as they pertain to the domains. The indicators present the percent of households that responded affirmatively to each question within a domain, regardless of the frequency of the experience. Thus they measure the percent of households experiencing the condition within a domain at any level of severity.\n\nPercent of households with anxiety and uncertainty about the household food supply\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{Number of households with Q1 = 1}}{\\text{Total number of households responding to Q1}} ~ \\times ~ 100 \\]\n\nPercent of households with insufficient good quality\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{No. of households with Q2 = 1 OR Q3 = 1 OR Q4 = 1}}{\\text{Total no. of households responding to Q2 OR Q3 OR Q4}} ~ \\times ~ 100 \\]\n\nPercent of households with insufficient food intake\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{No. of households with Q5 = 1 OR Q6 = 1 OR Q7 = 1 OR Q8 = 1 OR Q9 = 1}}{\\text{Total no. of households responding to Q5 OR Q6 OR Q7 OR Q8 OR Q9}} ~ \\times ~ 100 \\]\n\n\n9.3.3 Household Food Insecurity Access Scale Score\nThe HFIAS score is a continuous measure of the degree of food insecurity (access) in the household in the past four weeks (30 days).\nFollowing are the steps in calculating the HFIAS score.\n\nCode the frequency-of-occurrence as 0 for all cases where the answer to the corresponding occurrence question was “no” (i.e., if Q1=0 then Q1a=0, if Q2=0 then Q2a=0, etc.).\nCalculate a HFIAS score variable is calculated for each household by summing the codes for each frequency-of-occurrence question. The maximum score for a household is 27 (the household response to all nine frequency-of-occurrence questions was “often”, coded with response code of 3); the minimum score is 0 (the household responded “no” to all occurrence questions, frequency-of-occurrence questions were skipped by the interviewer, and subsequently coded as 0 by the data analyst.) The higher the score, the more food insecurity (access) the household experienced. The lower the score, the less food insecurity (access) a household experienced.\n\n\\[ \\text{HFIAS Score} = Q1a + Q2a + Q3a + Q4a + Q5a + Q6a + Q7a + Q8a + Q9a \\]\n\nNext, the average Household Food Insecurity Access Scale Score, is calculated using the household scores calculated above.\n\n\\[ \\text{Average HFIAS score} ~ = ~ \\frac{\\sum{\\text{HFIAS scores in the sample}}}{\\text{Number of households sampled}} \\]\n\n\n9.3.4 Household Food Insecurity Access Prevalence\nThe final indicator is a categorical indicator of Food Insecurity Status. The Household Food Insecurity Access Prevalence (HFIAP) Status indicator can be used to report household food insecurity (access) prevalence and make geographic targeting decisions.\nBecause the average HFIAS score is a continuous variable, it is more sensitive to capturing smaller increments of changes over time than the HFIAP indicator. Therefore, the HFIAP indicator should be reported in addition to, rather than instead of, the average HFIAS Score for program monitoring and evaluation.\nThe HFIAP indicator categorizes households into four levels of household food insecurity (access): food secure, and mildly, moderately and severely food insecure. Households are categorized as increasingly food insecure as they respond affirmatively to more severe conditions and/or experience those conditions more frequently.\nFollowing are the steps in calculating the HFIAP indicator.\n\nThe data analyst should have coded frequency-of-occurrence as 0 for all cases where the answer to the corresponding occurrence question was “no” (i.e., if Q1=0 then Q1a=0, if Q2=0 then Q2a=0, etc.)\nCalculate a HFIA category variable for each household by assigning a code for the food insecurity (access) category in which it falls. The four food security categories should be created sequentially, in the same order as shown below, to ensure that households are classified according to their most severe response.\n\nCategory 1: Food secure\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{HFIA category 1 if } & (Q1a = 0 ~ or ~ Q1a = 1) ~ and ~ Q2 = 0 ~ and \\\\\n& Q3 = 0 ~ and ~ Q4 = 0 ~ and ~ Q5 = 0 ~ and ~ Q6 = 0 ~ and \\\\\n& Q7 = 0 ~ and ~ Q8 = 0 ~ and ~ Q9 = 0\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nCategory 2: Mildly food insecure access\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{HFIA category 2 if } & (Q1a = 2 ~ or ~ Q1a = 3 ~ or ~ Q2a = 1 ~ or \\\\\n& Q2a = 2 ~ or ~ Q2a = 3 ~ or ~ Q3a = 1 ~ or ~ Q4a = 1) ~ and \\\\\n& Q5 = 0 ~ and ~ Q6 = 0 ~ and ~ Q7 = 0 ~ and ~ Q8 = 0 ~ and ~ Q9 = 0\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nCategory 3: Moderately food insecure access\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{HFIA category 3 if } & (Q3a = 2 ~ or ~ Q3a = 3 ~ or ~ Q4a = 2 ~ or Q4a = 3 ~ or \\\\\n& Q5a = 1 ~ or ~ Q5a = 2 ~ or ~ Q6a = 1 ~ or ~ Q6a = 2) ~ and \\\\\n& Q7 = 0 ~ and ~ Q8 = 0 ~ and ~ Q9 = 0\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nCategory 4: Severely food insecure access\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{HFIA category 4 if } & Q5a = 3 ~ or ~ Q6a = 3 ~ or ~ Q7a = 1 ~ or \\\\\n& Q7a = 2 ~ or ~ Q7a = 3 ~ or ~ Q8a = 1 ~ or ~ Q8a = 2 ~ or \\\\\n& Q8a = 3 ~ or ~ Q9a = 1 ~ or ~ Q9a = 2 ~ or ~ Q9a = 3\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\nNext, the prevalence of different levels of household food insecurity (access) is calculated.\n\n\nPercentage of households that are food secure\n\n\\[ \\% ~ \\text{households that are food secure} ~ = ~\\frac{\\text{No. of households with HFIA category = 1}}{\\text{Total no. of households with a HFIA category}} \\]\n\nPercentage of households that are mildly food insecure\n\n\\[ \\% ~ \\text{households that are mildly food insecure} ~ = ~\\frac{\\text{No. of households with HFIA category = 2}}{\\text{Total no. of households with a HFIA category}} \\]\n\nPercentage of households that are moderately food insecure\n\n\\[ \\% ~ \\text{households that are moderately food insecure} ~ = ~\\frac{\\text{No. of households with HFIA category = 3}}{\\text{Total no. of households with a HFIA category}} \\]\n\nPercentage of households that are severely food insecure\n\n\\[ \\% ~ \\text{households that are severely food insecure} ~ = ~\\frac{\\text{No. of households with HFIA category = 4}}{\\text{Total no. of households with a HFIA category}} \\]",
