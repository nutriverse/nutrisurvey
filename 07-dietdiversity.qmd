# Measuring dietary diversity {#diet}

## Introduction
Dietary diversity can be measured in various ways with the traditional approach being time consuming, expensive, and requiring a high level of technical skill both in data collection and analysis. Recent development work in this indicator has brought about the use of a qualitative approach to food consumption that reflects household access to a wide variety of foods, and is also a proxy of the nutrient adequacy of the diet for individuals. The approach uses a specifically designed and tested dietary diversity questionnaire as a tool to elicit food consumption information in a more rapid, user-friendly and cost-effective approach. Administration of the questionnaire is straightforward and can be handled easily by trained enumerators. The scoring and/or analysis of the information gained from the questionnaire is easy to understand, quick to implement, and can be applied with minimal technical expertise.

In general, dietary diversity indicators are created by summing either the number of individual foods or food groups consumed over a reference period. This [chapter](#diet) describes how an individual dietary diversity indicator is created through a simple count of food groups that an individual has consumed over the past 24 hours. Specifically, this [chapter](#diet) discusses how the minimum dietary diversity indicator for women (MDD-W) and the minimum dietary diversity indicator for children under 2 years old (MDD) are calculated using a standard dietary diversity questionnaire.

## Minimum dietary diversity for women (MDD-W)

MDD-W is a dichotomous indicator of whether or not women 15–49 years of age have consumed at least five out of ten defined food groups the previous day or night. The proportion of women 15–49 years of age who reach this minimum in a population can be used as a proxy indicator for higher micronutrient adequacy, one important dimension of diet quality.

The indicator is calculated as follows:

$$ \text{MDD-W} = \frac{\text{Women 15-49 years of age who consumed 5 out of 10 food groups in the previous day or night}}{\text{Women 15-49 years of age}} $$

The ten food groups are:

1. Grains, white roots and tubers, and plantains
2. Pulses (beans, peas and lentils)
3. Nuts and seeds
4. Dairy
5. Meat, poultry and fish
6. Eggs
7. Dark green leafy vegetables
8. Other vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables
9. Other vegetables
10. Other fruits

## Minimum dietary diversity (MDD) component of the infant and young child feeding (IYCF)

MDD component of the IYCF indicators is a dichotomous indicator of whether or not children 6-23 months of age receive foods from 4 or more food groups (out of a total of 7 food groups for children). The proportion of children 6–23 months of age who receive foods from 4 or more food groups is associated with better quality diets for both breastfed and non-breastfed children. Consumption of foods from at least 4 food groups on the previous day would mean that in most populations the child had a high likelihood of consuming at least one animal-source food and at least one fruit or vegetable that day, in addition to a staple food (grain, root or tuber).

The indicator is calculated as follows:

$$ \text{MDD} = \frac{\text{Children 6–23 months of age who received foods from} \geq \text{ 4 food groups during the previous day}}{\text{Children 6–23 months of age}} $$

The 7 foods groups used for tabulation of this indicator are:

1. Grains, roots and tubers
2. Legumes and nuts
3. Dairy products (milk, yoghurt, cheese)
4. Fresh foods (meat, fish, poultry and liver/organ meats)
5. Eggs
6. Vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables
7. Other fruits and vegetables

Consumption of any amount of food from each food group is sufficient to “count”, i.e., there is no minimum quantity, except if an item is only used as a condiment.

### MDD food group description

The food group description for MDD-W is about the same for the IYCF MDD with a few exceptions:

**1. Ice cream**

In MDD-W, ice cream is categorised as "sweets" because it is a high fat/high sugar food. For IYCF MDD, ice cream is categorised as dairy.

This difference is primarily due to increasing concerns with other dimensions of diet quality in the context of the nutrition transition given that ice cream is a high fat and high sugar food and also because many low-quality ice cream products contain very little dairy.

**2. Garlic**

In MDD-W, garlic is categorised as "condiments and seasonings" given that it is usually consumed in small quantities. In IYCF MDD, there is no particular concern for food quantity so garlic is categorised as "other fruits and vegetables".

**3. Olives**

In MDD-W, olives are categorised as "other foods and beverages" given that it is usually consumed in small quantities. In IYCF MDD, olives are categorised as "other fruits and vegetables".

**4. Red palm oil**
